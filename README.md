# apngr - simple APNG multitool
apngr provides the ability to:

  * Combine multiple PNGs into a single APNG via `animate`
  * Extract frames from an APNG via `extract`
  * Query frame data from an APNG via `query`
  * Convert a GIF into an APNG via `convert`

It primarily exists as a means for testing [kettek/apng](https://github.com/kettek/apng) and has not been used for much beyond ensuring apng's functionality.

## Notes
It currently lacks support for converting disparate PNG images -- whether in size or image format -- however this will be addressed in the future either directly in the *kettek/apng* package or in this utility.
